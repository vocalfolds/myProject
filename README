This is the first Django app I wrote. In README I will record all python or shell commands. In each file developed, for every step, I will write git log into every commit. This will be my first time actually using git in serious. The intent is just to get a little more familiarer with git. Anyway, to really master this technique, practice is a must, just like in those days I learn Latex, Auctex, and Org-Mode. 

In this example, I will be guided to create a basic poll application.
It'll consist of two parts:
* A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
* An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.

# Create a Django project
$ django-admin.py startproject myproject

Setup a project in github. The name is myProject. 

# In local machine
$ git init 
$ touch README
$ git add README
$ git add *.py
$ git commit -m 'first commit'
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:vocalfolds@gmail.com/myProject.git
$ git push origin master

# Run the sever for the first time
$ python2 manage.py runserver

Open a web brower and type url as: http://127.0.0.1:8000/, you will see a basic web page hosted by a lightweight web server
# To change the default port
$ python2 mange.py runserver 8080

If you want to change the sever's IP, pass it aong with the port. So listen on all public IPs
$ python2 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080 &

Set up database, for simplicity, I just use SQLite
ENGINE 'django.db.backends.sqlite3'
NAME  '/home/herostone/tmp/djangoExample/myproject/sqlite3.db'

$python2 manage.py syncdb

setup a user for SQLite database: herostone
pass: address

$ sqlite3 sqlite3.db
>.schema
>.help
>.exit

$ git add README 
$ git add settings.py
$ git add sqlite3.db

$ git commit -m ''
$ git push origin

Setup app
$ python2 manage.py startapp polls
$ git add polls/
$ git status -s
$ git commit -m 'Setup app poll'
